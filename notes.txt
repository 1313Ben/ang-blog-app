Sharing data between components:
1. Parent to child component via @Input decorator
2. Child to parent component via @Output decorator or via @ViewChild decorator
3. Child to Parent when there is Event, using the @Output decorator and event Emitter

Sharing data using @Output & Event Emitter:
This approach is ideal when we want to share data changes thatt occur on things like button clicks,
form entries, and other user events.
